                        <p>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence, where a machine learns without
                            explicitly programmed, machine learning concerns the development and study of statistical
                            algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus
                            perform tasks without explicit instructions.</p>
                        <p>Machine learning is a set of algorithms. It involves using algorithms to identify hidden
                            patterns in datasets, enabling predictions on new data. </p>

                        <p>For a human the learning basically is reading, understating and answering. These are the
                            three simple steps we as a human follow. Similarly, to make a machine learn, we make the
                            machine to follow the same three simple steps. In machine terms those are collecting data,
                            processing data and making predictions out of it.</p>
                        <p>To make a machine learn from our data, the data needs to be in a machine-understandable way
                            so our first step is data preprocessing, after making the data into machine
                            machine-understandable format we need to treat the data to the machine. For perfect
                            training, we required a perfect model so our next step is to select a perfect model. Now
                            machine is giving the desired results then we have to deploy our model in a real-time
                            environment this is where deployment comes into the picture.</p>

                        <p>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models relay on large data sets develop accurate models in
                            various contexts. Data Augmentation helps filling out missing values and increase the data
                            size by including variety of data. this helps in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>improving model accuracy</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Reduced data dependency (not being depending on larger data for training)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>improving model robustness (Including data in such a way that it include all
                                    situations, such as noise and most unexpected situations to make model trained model
                                    strong)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Mitigate overfitting in training data</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Data augmentation can be applied when the training data is too small, when there is
                            overfitting in the datasets or if there is lot of missing variables in the datasets. the
                            augumentation can be applies in different areas such as <strong>image Augmentation,Text data
                                Augmentation and Audio Data augmentation </strong></p>

                        <al>Text Augmentation</al>
                        <p>Text augmentation is the process of artificially generating new text from existing text,
                            primarily to train machine learning (ML) models or NLP models. The fields like computer
                            vision and natural language processing require large and varied datasets for initial
                            training. Making the dataset more robust and generalizable improves the performance of the
                            model. There are various text augmentation techniques that can be applied to improve the
                            performance of the model. Majorly text augmentation input replacing , adding, removing,
                            shuffling, etc. lets see some of the text augmentation techniques.</p>
                        <SS>Most widely used text augmentation techniques are as follows</SS><br><br>

                            the nouns with their respective synonyms. the synonyms are generated using WordNet(a popular

                        <p>The technique is quite systematically named. We are literally mixing up the features and
                            their corresponding labels. we are creating new virtual dataset from the training data set
                            by mixing up the features and their corresponding labels. the implementation is basically
                            creating a NN model making it generate a new input and a new output labels.</p>

                        <p>Audio recognition systems such as Google assistant, Alexa, Amazon Echo etc.. are developed on Audio data and detecting more complex audios is a challenge. as people are more interested into voice assistants it is more important to detect the audio form most complex environments such as noisy, low audio, multiple audios etc.. The systems only achieve this complex tasks by making it to train through such data sets. But collecting such datasets needs lot of human effort. Hence this is where data augmentation comes to rescue. By using this techniques we can build more robust and large datasets to make detection more accurate.</p>

                        <p>Time Series Data is basically known as sequence of data points over a period of time. We basically observe this kind of data in Stock market and IOT applications. Treating this data to be Augmented as the previous three techniques cause problem. Because previous every record is concorded as the individual data points. But we need to treat a sequence of data points as a single data point in timeseries. Time series data augmentation follows its suppurate techniques. Such as GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) and Autoencoders. </p>
                        <p><SS>Traditional algorithms</SS> this techniques can tbe applied directly to time series data. instead we divide the entire data into a group of time stramps. then applying then applying to one of them or some of them and then adding it to original data set results in increase in size of data.. it can also be said that some of them does not support so being selective would be effective.</p>

                        <p>Gan architecture is based on the computation between two Neural Networks known to be generator and discriminator. the generator is used to generate fake data and the discriminator is used to differentiate between real and fake data. the whole task is to fool the discriminator. in this way we have more data points. in case of time series data, we can use this technique to generate data points that are similar to the original data points for a particular period of time.</p>
                        <al>Virtual autoencoder</al>
                        <p>This is a Encoder and decoder architecture. Majorly used in unSupervised learning where there is no labels. So here we use the encoder to make the input datapoints into smaller dimensions and decoder to make it back to original. so here we are basically generating new data points by making it generate back the original data.</p>

                        <h2>Dimensionality reduction</h2>
                        <P>Dimensionality reduction is a technique to reduce the number of feature in the dataset. Basically higher the number of feature slower the model will be and model leads to overfitting. the data fits well on the training data but fails to generalize well on new or testing data. The main aim of the Dimensionality reductions is get more information out of the entire data into fewer features and also to remove the features that has no/less effect on the model. We apply Dimensionality reduction to make model faster ,reduce complexity and improve performance.</P>
                        <p>Dimensionality reduction is a technique which selects or extracts completely independent features that has the maximum impact on the model.</p>
                        <p>Having more features results in high dimensional visualization which is hard to interpret and generalize. which may results in complex model formation</p>
                        <p> For Dimensionality reduction there are two main approaches  <SS>Feature Extraction</SS>,<SS>Feature Selection</SS></p>
                        <p><SS>Feature Extraction : </SS> It involves creating new features from original by combining or transforming exiting features. the ogle is to create a set of d feature form n features (d<=n) such that d features capture the essence of the n features</p>
                        <p>Some of the feature extraction techniques are as follows<SS>Principal Component Analysis(PCA),Singular Value Decomposition(SVD),Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) etc..</SS></p>
                        <p><SS>Feature Selection : </SS> It involves selecting a subset of features from the original set of features. the goal is to select a subset of features that are most relevant and can have the maximum information content</p>
                        <p>Some of the feature selection techniques are <SS>Filter methods</SS>,<SS>Wrapper methods</SS>,<SS>Embedding method</SS></p>

                        <al>Principal component analysis (PCA)</al>
                        <p>Principal component analysis is a Feature Extraction technique where Higher dimensional data is transformed into lower dimensional data with the most important information. here we are using covariance matrix to higher dimensional and getting eigen vector and racking the eigen values to select the eigen vectors . this is most effective reduction technique as it uses the covariance matrix which gives the correlation between the feature. </p>
                        <p>Before we get started, we shall take a quick look at the difference between covariance and variance. Variance measures the variation of a single random variable (like the height of a person in a population), whereas covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together (like the height of a person and the weight of a person in a population). The formula for variance is given by</p>
                        <p>$$\\sigma^2_x = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$$</p>
                        <p>and the formula for covariance is given by</p>
                        <p>$$cov(x,y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$$</p>
                        <p><SS>Covariance : </SS>where x and y are two random variables, n is the number of observations, and x_i and y_i are the values of the random variables at observation i.so we are considering two features x and y from a set of features in the dataset and finding covariance between each pair of features which represents how this features vary together. <a>$$\\text{Covariance varies between } -\\infty \\text{ and } \\infty$$</a> which means cov(x,y) > 0 employs features related in same direction, cov(x,y) < 0 represents features releated in opposite direction and cov(x,y)=0 represents independent features. if the number of fetures are n then we form the matrix of size n x n by finding the covarince between each pair.</p>
                        <p>$$\\text{Covariance matrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{xx} &amp; \\sigma_{xy} \\\\ \\sigma_{yx} &amp; \\sigma_{yy} \\end{bmatrix}$$</p>

                        <p><SS>Eigan values and Eigan vectors :</SS>Here we use Eigan values and Eigan vectors to reduce the Dimensionality of the covariance matrix. It helps in finding the important information out of all features in lower dimensional space. ⋋ represents Eigan value and X represents Eigan vector. ⋋ ranks the Eigan vectors such that higher the rank the more information the Eigan vector posses, Eigan vectors are the set of independent vectors.</p>
                        <p>$$Ax=\\lambda x$$</p>
                        <p>$$(A-\\lambda I)x=0$$</p>
                        <p>$$det(A-\\lambda I)=0$$</p>
                        <p> we can find the eigen values and eigen vectors using this mathematically, for more info <a href="https://byjus.com/jee/eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors-problems-and-solutions/">Vist</a></p>

                        <p>as we seen earlier we are using LangChain and Titan integration get the responses to our prompts which are sent using python. But for any Realtime projects it has to be sent through an webpage but though webpage we cant directly access this all code manually. as webpage uses HTML/CSS and we use python for communication. this is where <SS>API</SS> comes into picture. API's can be accessed through any platforms such as HTML/JS/react to post and get the information. API is not a code it is a link that can be accessed easily.</p>
                        <p>I am using FastAPI for building an API for the Langchain & Bedrocks integration. if we give the input as a prompt to the API then it will give us back the output. this pigmentation is done using <SS>Fast API</SS>.</p>
                        <p><SS>Fast API</SS> gives you lot of flexibility to build high performing API's in user most easy implementation techniques for production environments. </p>

                        <p>lets simplify it, so as i said you when you are running a python code it gives you the output according to what ever function your python code is written for , it might be regarding a machine learning library(sciket learn), or a numpy, pandas for data processing. so how this is done, fist if you want to use a machine learning library you need to install it on to your machine then write a python code to give the input and get the output. that is how you can perform functions on your machine. But when it comes to real time deployment you are not only representing it on your machine but also public machines, but we dont know if the public machine has that particular library installed. so it is our task to make sure that every one could get the results. this is when docker comes into picture, docker provides you a virtual machine (os, this is the machine that is hosted on the cloud) where you can install all the requirements and the instructions to get the outputs when they give the input. you just need to ask the Virtual Machine that is hosted on the cloud.</p>
                        <p><SS>What are this instructions ?</SS> Instructions are basically the commands you are writing on a dockerFile. that include to use this particular base image (in our case python), to install some set of library's, to run some code and lot more .</p>

                        <br><pa> So a neural network is basically the connections of nodes. where this nodes are grouped as layers. this layers are classified as input layers, hidden layers and output layers. the nodes in a input layer represents input features and the nodes in output layer represent the predicted output. But the nodes in the hidden layers has some suppurate functionality where it is responsible for the mathematical operations such as Matrix multiplication and activation functions. Each node in the hidden layer is capable of generating outputs by this operations. the nodes in one layer are connected to the nodes in the other layer. this connections are assigned with certain values this are known as the weights. this weights involve in the Matrix multiplication. Each node is assigned with a bias value. Bias is added to the Matrix multiplication to get the output. this output is then passed through the activation function to produce the final output of that particular node. so output of previous layer acts as the input to the next layer. The output of the last layer is the final output. </pa><br>

                        <br><pa><strong>Why use Activation Function?</strong> The outputs, calculated using weights and biases, are passed through an activation function to introduce non-linearity. An activation function determines which data should proceed forward, enhancing output efficiency by limiting unnecessary data flow through nodes. It is a mathematical operation applied to node outputs that leads to effective learning. For better understanding, consider a classification problem where the node output is a numerical value. Activation functions help convert these numerical outputs into class labels. Functions like sigmoid or tanh adjust the output to determine if it should be activated or remain unchanged.</pa><br>
                        <br><pa>Without an activation function, the model behaves like a linear regression model, producing only numerical outputs. This limitation makes it challenging to perform classification tasks and when dealing with datasets containing only positive values. By applying the ReLU activation function, we can effectively restrict negative values, ensuring more accurate and meaningful predictions.</pa><br>
                        <br><pa>We apply an activation function at each node to ensure that outputs are activated, which enhances the model's ability to solve complex problems and capture non-linear relationships. <SS>Linear functions</SS> allow all data to pass through and are typically used in regression tasks. In contrast, <SS>non-linear functions</SS> introduce non-linearity, transforming outputs before they proceed. Examples include Softmax, Sigmoid, and ReLU.</pa><br>

                        <p>Pub/Sub is also known to be Publish and Subscribe topology where publishers are some one sending data and subscribers are some one receiving data. This can’t be used in bidirectional communication such as chat applications or important notification systems where the information needs to reliably reach the destination without any data loss.
</p>
                        <p>In Redis, publishers are not programmed to send their messages to specific subscribers. Rather, published messages are sent into channels, without knowledge of what (if any) subscribers there may be.
</p>
                        <p>Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more channels and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what (if any) publishers there are.
</p>
                        <p>one major drawback of this pub/sub model is that it is not persisted, that means if a particular subscriber is offline during a period then the messages published at that instance are missed by the user.
</p>
                        <p>Also Redis pub sub will not work with multinode architecture, the reason behand it is due to its low availability and localisation of publisher and subscriber. the Redis connection factory is made for master node not with worker nodes. Redis pub sub is lightening fast coming to live applications due to its single node architecture.

                        <P>In sendMessage(), you iterate over emitters and remove any that fail. This is correct.However, you could improve safety by using CopyOnWriteArrayList iterators or by collecting stale emitters and removing them after iteration (to avoid ConcurrentModificationException if you ever switch to a different collection).</P>
